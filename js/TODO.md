bugs:

third obstacle not appearing, or timing might be off?

change obstacle sprites

change player sprites: different sprites for players 1 and 2

stop timer after finish (currently just paused)

smooth transition after collision

add music

add restart option

set up backend to store global scores (try new framework?)

work on menu design

clean up game and player functions

short pause before clearing and displaying end menu

add quit function for game (invoked by q keypress)
