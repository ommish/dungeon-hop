bugs:

third obstacle not appearing, or timing might be off?

slow down fast AI

change obstacle sprites

change player sprites: different sprites for players 1 and 2

stop timer after finish (currently just paused)

add music

add restart option

set up backend to store global scores (try new framework?)
